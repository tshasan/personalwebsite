# Why Internet Browsers Matter Today

In my quest to find the best internet browser, I've realized that sometimes you can't have it all. Choosing a browser often means deciding what you're willing to sacrifice for peace of mind. Let's take a look at the three major players: Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

# Safari: The Apple Default

Safari's large user base is largely due to it being the default browser on Apple products. However, its performance on Apple Silicon laptops is noteworthy, often showing a 2x speed increase compared to Firefox and being more battery and memory efficient than other browsers.

However, Safari has significant limitations, especially in terms of extension or plugin support. Many decent options are behind a paywall. Apple's restrictive WebKit API means popular plugins like uBlock Origin are not available for Safari, which is a dealbreaker for me.

# Firefox: The Open Source Contender

Firefox, the open-source FOSS browser, doesn't have many drawbacks, except for its performance lagging behind Chromium and Safari browsers. In terms of privacy, Firefox offers a lot, with variants like Mullvad, Waterfox, Librefox, Pale Moon, and the famous Tor Browser. However, these flavors of Firefox often suffer from compatibility and performance issues. For those prioritizing internet privacy, Librefox and the Arkenfox user.js are considered top choices for clearnet browsing.

# Chrome: The Reigning King

Chrome is the most widely used browser, becoming the default choice for many due to its integration with Google products like Google Search, Gmail, and YouTube. This integration, however, is not the sole reason for its popularity. Websites are often optimized for Chrome, and it outperforms Firefox on Windows and Linux to some extent.

However, there's growing concern over privacy with big tech companies. The targeted ads and data optimization from your emails and YouTube history are intrusive. Using Chrome can feel like installing spyware, given the evidence of these companies acting against user interests by monetizing personal data.

Google invests in developing their open-source Chromium project, which forms the basis for browsers like Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, Kiwi, Opera GX, and Microsoft Edge. These are essentially Chrome extensions with less Google influence.

Projects like Ungoogled Chromium and Thorium aim to provide privacy features absent in Chrome. They offer Chrome's performance and compatibility without the privacy concerns. However, browsers like Thorium, being a one-man project, often lag in updates, increasing vulnerability to hacking. Ungoogled Chromium doesn't have these issues but requires manual installation and makes adding Chrome plugins challenging.

I experimented with Vivaldi but found its maximalist approach overwhelming for someone who just wants to surf the web. It's a solid alternative for those who value customization and features.

# My Choice: Brave Browser

After much consideration, I've settled on Brave Browser. It strikes a balance between privacy features, auto-updating security patches, and future support reliability. While some criticize its Chromium base as contributing to a near-monopoly, I appreciate its solid open-source foundation. Brave does include some bloat, like cryptocurrency and blockchain features, which I'm not particularly interested in. For AI, I'm currently more inclined towards ChatGPT-4.

In conclusion, Brave Browser offers an optimal mix of performance, privacy, and functionality that, in my opinion, currently no other browser matches.

TLDR: Google Chrome is basically spyware and a dataharvesting platform.
