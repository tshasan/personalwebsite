## Markdown is cool ##
What makes markdown cool is that you dont really have to be that good in HTML to make stuff for a website.

![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)

adding this logo is was pretty easy and its the markdown logo

This website uses inspiration from many astro website templates
but the goal is to be original and not rip someone off.

> Showing off your code is pretty easy 

    fn main() {
        println!("hey")
    }

Overall for this being the first time using markdown
